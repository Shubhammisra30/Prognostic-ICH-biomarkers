The Python Code provides pipeline for random forest based machine learning analysis for identifying the clinical and protein biomarker predictors of poor outcome and mortality after intracerebral hemorrhage.

We employed a random forest-based machine learning algorithm to identify additional predictors. Categorical data were encoded in binary form, while continuous data were standardized based on the population mean and standard deviation following log-normalization for skewed distributions. Train-test splits were executed in a 7:3 ratio, and random forest models with 1000 estimators were trained using the scikit-learn package. This process was repeated 1000 times, with each iteration involving a new random seed to choose the top 10 variables for prediction. Shapley values were computed using the SHAP package, and absolute means were utilized to evaluate variable importance.
